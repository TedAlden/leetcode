# [20. Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/)

## Problem

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

**Example 4:** 

```
Input: s = "([])"
Output: true
```

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.

## Implementation

Python

```python
class Solution(object):
  def isValid(self, s):
    """
    :type s: str
    :rtype: bool
    """

    stack = []
    matches = {
    ")" : "(",
    "}" : "{",
    "]" : "["
    }

    for char in s:
      # if it's a closing bracket, attempt to match it
      if char in ")}]":
        # if there's nothing in the stack to match it with,
        # then the expression is not balanced
        if not stack:
          return False
        # the current character should pair with the last
        # character in the stack, if not, it is unbalanced
        elif stack.pop() != matches[char]:
          return False
      # else, it's an opening bracket, add it to the stack
      else:
        stack.append(char)
    # the stack will be empty if all parentheses are balanced
    return len(stack) == 0
```
