# [9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)

# Problem

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a **palindrome**, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:** 

- `-2^31<= x <= 2^31- 1`

**Follow up:**  Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## Implementation

Python

```python
class Solution(object):
  def isPalindrome(self, x):
    """
    :type x: int
    :rtype: bool
    """
    num = x
    reversed_num = 0

    if num < 0:
      return False

    while num != 0:
      # remove the digit from the original number
      digit = num % 10
      num //= 10
      # add digit to reversed number
      reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + digit

    return x == reversed_num
```
